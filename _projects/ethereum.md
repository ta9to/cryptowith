## イーサリアム(Ethereum)の歴史

Bitcoin was a radical innovation for money and currency. However, the underlying blockchain technology can be used for much more than direct financial exchanges. Ethereum is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language – a decentralized computer. Now, you can create “contracts” that self-execute, and allow complex systems like decentralized autonomous organizations as well as many other things that we have not yet imagined by simply writing code. Since launch, Ethereum became the world’s most popular blockchain for development. It became also known for The DAO hack and resulting split in Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, and for setting standards such as the ERC-20 token. Today, it is by far the most innovative and thriving ecosystem that enables layer 2 protocols and 1000s of dApps in all industries, especially in DeFi with “money legos” that are based on each other. Ethereum is in the process of switching to ETH 2, a state-of-the-art PoS blockchain to meet industry requirements and become the backbone of open finance and Web 3.
